# Description of your program (part 7)
To count the number or words in this txt doc
- read the document into a variable in the program
- go through the doument character by character if the character is space or a new line add one to the count
- stop when we get to the end of the document

alternate method:
- read document
- use a method in a library that has a word count funciton.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
I am worried that I missed something in the steps. It isn't satisfying not being able
to check and see if my method works to count the words. I also don't know the specifics
on how the file would read in and what sort of aditional steps would be required before
we could parse through the chars, or what libraries could help for us.

I would like to learn more applications for python outside of an console or ide, like
desktop or mobble apps, or external hardware like rasberry pi.
